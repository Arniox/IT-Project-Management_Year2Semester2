                                    <b>Description of Trello (from website):</b><br>
                                    Whether you're at work, at home, or anywhere in between, Trello's simple and flexible design lets your team collaborate and organize everything (literally, everything—from the day-to-day operations of your business to your next family vacation).<br>
                                    <b>Board Basics</b><br>
                                    A Trello board only has four key components, but comes with unlimited possibility:<br>
                                    <img src="Images/01.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:100%"><br>
                                    <ul>
                                      <li>Boards - A board represents a project or a place to keep track of information. Whether you are launching a new website, or planning a vacation, a Trello board is the place to organize your tasks and collaborate with your colleagues, family, or friends.</li>li>
                                      <li>Lists - Lists keep cards (C) organized in their various stages of progress. They can be used to create a workflow where cards are moved across lists from start to finish, or simply act as a place to keep track of ideas and information. There’s no limit to the number of lists you can add to a board, and they can be arranged however you like.
                                      <img src="https://d2k1ftgv7pobq7.cloudfront.net/meta/u/res/images/trello-101/601f28994df3d5a508df5af209d301a0/02.png" class="img-fluid"><br>
                                      A basic (but effective) list setup for a board might be simply To Do, Doing, and Done, where cards start in the To Do list and make their way to the Done list. But don't forget: Trello is truly customizable to your unique needs, so you can name your lists anything you like! Whether it's basic Kanban, a sales pipeline, a marketing calendar, or project management, what matters most is establishing a workflow for the way your team works.<br>
                                      <img src="https://d2k1ftgv7pobq7.cloudfront.net/meta/u/res/images/trello-101/77a6e49f565bf09ac540a3fd69427e94/03.jpg" class="img-fluid">
                                      </li>
                                      <li>Cards - The fundamental unit of a board is a card. Cards are used to represent tasks and ideas. A card can be something that needs to get done, like a blog post to be written, or something that needs to be remembered, like company vacation policies. Just click “Add a card…” at the bottom of any list to create a new card, and give it a name like "Pick up the dry cleaning" or "Write a blog post."<br>
                                      Cards can be customized to hold a wide variety of useful information by clicking on them. Drag and drop cards across lists to show progress. There’s no limit to the number of cards you can add to a board.<br>

                                        Menu - On the right side of your Trello board is the menu—the mission control center for your board. The menu is where you manage members, control settings, filter cards, and enable Power-Ups. You can also see all of the activity that has taken place on a board in the menu’s activity feed. Take some time to check out everything the menu has to offer.
